PEER-SAMPLING SERVICE

General parameters
  - Cycle: 3 seconds
  - Maximum view size: 7 peers

Each node maintains
  - Address to send/receive messages (NodePid)
  - View of the peers (list of neighbours) -> contains NodeIds of other nodes.
  - Current value of cycle.

Active thread
  - Wait X second for the cycle (3 seconds)
  - Chooses a peer from the view to exchage view with


Questions
  - How to differentiate the active and passive threads ?
    More precisely, how can the active and the passive thread share the view ?
  - When exchanging its view with another node, should a node put a fresh age to
    the sent peers, or should it keep the age that was in its view ?
  - The Tree doesn't contain the node PIDs, is it a problem ?
    Because, when we start the peer-sampling service, each node has its neighbours
    in the tree as peers, so we need to send messages to them.
  - In the article, it is asked to always send c/2 - 1 peers.
    For the project, c = 7, so how many peers do we need to send ? 3 ?
  - With the removal of the H oldest peers, and the S first ones, won't the size
    of the view drop below 7 ?
